---------------------------------------API---------------------------------------- 
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that defines how software programs and systems can communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediatery between the two systems allowing them to exchange data and functionality. They are widely used in web development to enable the integration of different services and applications, such as connecting a web application to a database or integrating third-party services like payment gateways or social media platforms.

GET: Retrieve a representation of a resource.
POST: Create a new resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource or create a new resource if it does not exist.
DELETE: Delete a resource
