---------------------------------------API---------------------------------------- 
API stands for Application Programming Interface. It is a set of rules and protocols that defines how software programs and systems can communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediatery between the two systems allowing them to exchange data and functionality. They are widely used in web development to enable the integration of different services and applications, such as connecting a web application to a database or integrating third-party services like payment gateways or social media platforms.

-------------------------------------RESTful API----------------------------
A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is an API that adheres to the principles and constraints of REST (Representational State Transfer). REST is an architectural style for designing networked applications, particularly web services, that communicate over HTTP.

HTTP Methods in RESTful APIs
RESTful APIs commonly use standard HTTP methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on resources:

GET: Retrieve a representation of a resource.
POST: Create a new resource.
PUT: Update an existing resource or create a new resource if it does not exist.
DELETE: Delete a resource

-------------------------------------Node-------------------

Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code on the server side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine (developed by Google for Chrome)and for firefox(spider monkey)

---------------------------Library-------------------
A library is a collection of pre-written code that developers can use to perform common tasks and functions. Libraries provide specific functionalities and are used to simplify complex tasks by offering reusable components. When you use a library, you call its functions or methods directly in your code. The control flow of the program remains in your hands.

-----------------------Framework-----------------------------------
A framework is a comprehensive platform that provides a foundation and structure for developing applications. Frameworks dictate the architecture and flow of the application and often come with predefined conventions and patterns. When you use a framework, you follow its rules and structure, and the framework often calls your code at specific points.

--------------------Library & framework---------------
The technical difference between the library and framework due to the inversion of control.
This means the developer decides when to call the library. However, when we use a framework, the framework decides when to call the library. 

---------------------------ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)---------------
ORM is a technique that allows developers to interact with a relational database using an object-oriented paradigm. It maps database tables to classes in a programming language, enabling developers to perform database operations without writing raw SQL queries.

---------------------------ODM (Object-Document Mapping)-------------------
ODM is similar to ORM but is used for interacting with document-oriented databases, such as MongoDB. It maps documents in the database to objects in the programming language, allowing for object-oriented manipulation of data.
